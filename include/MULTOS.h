 * Bit Manipulate Byte
 *
 * This primitive performs bit-wise operations on the top byte of the
 * stack.
 *
 * The argument Option is a bitmap controlling what logical operation is
 * performed and MaskByte is a literal byte holding the mask to use for
 * operation.
 *
 * Stack input:  [ ByteIn ]
 * Stack output: [ ByteOut ]
 *
 * The 1-byte parameter ByteIn is the byte value that will be
 * manipulated according to the binary operation specified by Option
 * using the literal MaskByte as the second operand. The 1-byte value
 * ByteOut depends on the Options argument. It may be the original byte
 * or the result of the logical operation.
 *
 * Depending on the Option argument this primitive performs one of four
 * binary logical operations. They are:
 *  - AND: which returns a true bit only if both corresponding bits in
 *    the input and mask are true
 *  - OR: which returns a true bit if either of the corresponding bits
 *    in the input or mask are true
 *  - XOR: This is a logical Exclusive OR operation, which returns a
 *    true bit only if either of the corresponding bits in the input or
 *    mask are true, but false if both are true
 *  - EQU: This logical operation is also known as a Exclusive NOR
 *    (XNOR), which returns a true bit only if both corresponding bits
 *    in the input and mask are of the same value
 *
 * The following table shows how the Option argument is coded. The
 * numbers in the top row correspond to the bit offset, where the most
 * significant bit occupies offset 7.

 * Stack output:      []
 *
 * CBC mode requires the addition of an Initialisation Vector of length
 * equal to the block size for the selected algorithm. The 1-byte
 * parameter IVLen specifies the size of the Initialisation Vector. The
 * 2-byte parameter IVAddr is the address of the Initialisation Vector.
 * The size of the Initialisation Vector depends upon the specified
 * algorithm (DES: 8 bytes, 3DES: 8 bytes, SEED: 16 bytes, AES: 16
 * bytes).
 *
 * The 2-byte parameter InputLen specifies the number of bytes to
 * encipher. The 2-byte parameter KeyAddr is the address of the key(s)
 * to be used. The size and format of the key at this address depends
 * upon the specified algorithm (DES: one 8-byte DES key, 2-key 3DES:
 * two 8-byte DES keys of which the first key is located at address
 * KeyAddr and the second key at address KeyAddr + 8, 3-key 3DES: three
 * 8-byte DES keys of which the first key is located at address KeyAddr
 * and the second key at address KeyAddr + 8 and the third key at
 * address KeyAddr+16, SEED: one 16-byte key, AES: one 128 bit (16 byte)
 * AES key). The 1 byte parameter KeyLen is the length in bytes of the
 * key at address KeyAddr. The 2-byte parameter OutputAddr is the
 * starting address of the resultant ciphertext. The 2-byte parameter
 * InputAddr is the start address of the plaintext to be enciphered.
 *
 * This primitive performs the block encipher operation on a block of
 * memory of InputLen bytes. The algorithm used may be DES, 2-key 3DES,
 * 3-key 3DES, SEED and 128-bit key AES. The key is held in a block of
 * the appropriate length for the algorithm.
 *
 * The DES algorithms require that the plaintext length is a multiple of
 *  8 bytes and the SEED and AES-128 algorithms require that the
 * plaintext is a multiple of 16 bytes. If the plaintext length does not
 * meet these restrictions then the primitive will abend.
 *
 * The output is written at the specified segment address and this may
 * be the same as the address of the input; i.e., the output overwrites
 * the input. However, the output ciphertext cannot partially overlap
 * the input plaintext. If the primitive is called with partially
 * overlapping input and output memory areas then it abends. If an
 * Initialisation Vector is used then this can be at any segment
 * address, including in the input plaintext or output ciphertext memory
 * areas.
